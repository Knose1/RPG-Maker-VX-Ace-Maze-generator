about: If you need help with your own code

---

(Reminder: Your Issue must be based on this project, for example: you tried to add random chests generator for the maze but your code bug)  
  
**What kind of help do you need (choose)**  
1. I need help for a bug in my game using your maze generator  
2. I need help to make something for my game using your maze generator  
3. Other  
  
**Describe your problem**  
A clear and concise description of what the problem is.  

**Can you past a part of your code ?**
Pasting the whole or a part of your code help us to see the problem in your code.
```ruby
"Past your ruby code here"
```

**Did you try your code on [repl.it](https://repl.it/repls/KnottyMountainousNumbers) ?**
(Before testing the code you must set all the RPG Maker VX Ace library as a comment to avoid bug where there aren't)
This question is not required but please if you did it can you add a screen of the result (inside the console at right) also don't forget to add the random maze generator's script (else you'll get incomprehensible errors).
